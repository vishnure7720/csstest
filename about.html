                    <center><p>Someone that is not only going to get amazing images for you, but also that is going to mix in well with your day. 
                    I want you to be able to relax and enjoy your day to the fullest, trusting that after the day is done you are going
                     to have this amazing record of all those special moments with your loved ones, all the small details you spent so much
                      time choosing, and most importantly moments with your new love.</p></center>
                      <br><br>
                      <center><h3>Why I started the company </h3></center>
                      <center> <p> I founded OREGON Weddings back in 2013 shortly after I had moved to London from Vancouver Canada.  I had already 
                        been a photographer for over 10 years, photographing fashion, and portraits for magazines, working with some big 
                        celebrity photographers like ‘Bryan Adams’ and magazines like “Marie Claire” and “Elle”.  I had photographed a few 
                        weddings back in Vancouver and was starting to photograph the occasional wedding in London.
                        <br><br>
                        It was at this time friends were starting to get married and planning their weddings.  I would always get asked to 
                        help them find and book a photographer or videographer for their day. </p> </center>
                        
                      <center><h3> Who Are Our Photographers?</h3></center>
                              
                        
                       <center><p><h5>I love our photographers!</h5> some of our photographers have been with the company since we started.  They began as assistants and now
                         have thriving wedding photography businesses of their own and are some of our most booked photographers. We have
                          award winning photographers and videographers that have been published in magazines and blogs. </p></center>
                        
                       <center> <h3> We have photographers that shoot in Vintage, Classic, FineArt and Photojournalistic styles </h3></center>
                       <center><p>And we also have new talented photographers joining us all of the time.  I still think one of my best skills is
                         finding photographers that are super talented but just starting out.  These photographers are great at shooting
                          smaller weddings like registry office weddings and because the photographers are still building their portfolios
                           we can give our clients a great rate for their services.  It’s a WIN/WIN for everyone.</p></center>
